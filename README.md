# Instagram Video Rotator

Instagram Video Rotator is a lightweight Chrome extension that injects a button with a rotating icon under Instagram video elements. Clicking the button applies a CSS rotation animation to the video, giving it a smooth 360° spin.

## Features

  The extension dynamically adds a rotation button below every video on Instagram, including content loaded dynamically after the initial page load.
  
- **Animated Rotation Effect:**  
  A CSS animation rotates the video 360° when the button is clicked.
  
- **Responsive Design:**  
  Designed with a simple, inline-flex button that fits naturally into Instagram's UI.
